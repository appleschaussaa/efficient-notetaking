## Overview
​
### The challenge
​
Users should be able to:
​
- Use node powered by Javascript and express.js
- Use Insomnia and get/post pathways
- connect and deploy with Heroku

## My process
​
### Built with
​
- HTML/CSS
- Javascript
- Node and Express.js
- Insomnia
​
### What I learned
​
I really felt like this was going to be one of the easier recent challenges going into it, the main thing I learned was maybe start small and build out rather than doing all at once/inside one file. I planned to do the bulk of things inst my server.js file and then slim it down into seperate files to make it cleaner looking. Either was I feel like I learned a good amount on how to operate Insomnia and Heroku whereas I was about confused leading into this project. *last minute update* apparently heroku requires the package.json file to be in the root of the repo in order to deploy and I left it all in the deploy folder... which will now not let me copy to root and delete.
​
### Continued development
​
Possibly restarting from scrap and/or creating a new repo with parts of this one carried over. Definitely starting files to route to server would be an earlier step
​
### Useful resources
​
- [Example resource 1](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Express_Nodejs/Introduction) - was a nice reminder of oprating express
- [Example resource 2](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bootstrap-icons) - *update* Kind of thought this was going to be required.
- [Example resource 2](https://expressjs.com/en/api.html) - was planning to utilize this more
